can use ORM instead of sql queries
the ORM imports the database and creates objects for all tables and objects for all collumns
these objects can be used to make queries without directly writing any SQL e.g:
    db = Database('mydb.db')
    table1 = db.table1
    print(table1()) # all data from table1
    print(table1.get(table1.col1, table1.col2).filter(col1=2)) # SELECT col1, col2 FROM table1 WHERE col1 = 2
    table1.delete(table1.col1 >= 1)
All baisc CRUD operations are supported
a Table can be set to read only so only the .get and .get_distinct can be ran
Pretty print method added to table, it does what it says it does. Prints the table, prettily
