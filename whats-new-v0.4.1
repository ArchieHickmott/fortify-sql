can use ORM instead of sql queries
ORM can:
    make Column and Table classes for all tables in a database
    make SELECT queries (in accordance to SQLite SELECT documentaition excluding WITH RECURSIVE, WINDOW, compund operator and VALUES)
    make INSERT queries of form INSERT OR X INTO t(c,...) VALUES (v,...)
