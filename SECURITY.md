# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to notify a vulnerability creating an issue will do just fine as this package shouldn't really be used in any production environments. 
All security issues will be addressed in the next deployment of the package to Pypi

A security issue, once reported a vulnerability will have its own discussion under SECURITY NOTICES
